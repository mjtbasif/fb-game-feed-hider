# fb-game-feed-hider
This is a firefox extension. If you like to use the classical facebook design but annoyed with the game feed then you can use it to hide that panel from your firefox browser. 

I made this because no matter how many times i unfollow some stupid streamers, they keep showing me their uglyass faces.

With this little piece of extension i can finally enjoy the classical design without losing my cool.
