# fb-game-feed-hider
This is a firefox extension. If you like to use the classical facebook design but annoyed with the game feed then you can use it to hide that panel from your firefox browser. 

I made this because no matter how many times i unfollow some stupid streamers, they keep showing me their uglyass faces.

With this little piece of extension i can finally enjoy the classical design without losing my cool. 

# how to use it

1. download all the files and organize the files the way it is available here. 

2. open firefox and go to about:debugging 

3. go to "This Firefox"

4. click on "Load Temporary Add-On"

5. browse the files and select any of the files (for example, "manifest.js") 

# Add-on on Firefox

i will update the link as soon as it is listed on the gallery.
